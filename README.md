<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Material UI, in their documentation gives all you need for [SSR](https://mui.com/guides/server-rendering/). And [here](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/HEAD/examples/nextjs) is a sample implementation for Next JS integration with Material UI. The sample implementation is fairly good though you may come across some warning that is fixed in Manext. However, Manext is not only about the integration of MUI and NextJS. It takes the integration one step forward where a lot of boilerplate and common functionalities are taken care of.

Manext takes care that:
* Your time should be focused on creating something you actually want. Jump into the project directory and start writing your first component!
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like Handling Appbar Menu | Side Drawer | Notifications. 
* You should implement KISS and DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜ƒ

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
